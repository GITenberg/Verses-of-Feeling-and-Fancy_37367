<P CLASS="poem">
Worthless, the man who works&mdash;he knows not why,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom naught inspires to his puny plan,<BR>
Who seeming plays his part instinctively:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soulless, and falsely designated "man."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wicked, who works from wish of worldly gain,&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul surrendered to th'accursèd lust<BR>
Of pleasure partial, briefly to remain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of treasure liable to moth and rust.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Foolish and vain is he whose motive&mdash;fame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruled by desire of honor and renown;<BR>
And fondly courting Fortune's fickle Dame,&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day she smiles, to-morrow she will frown.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But virtuous, noble, prompted from above,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preluding now the perfect life again,<BR>
Is he, whose only inspiration, love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love to his God and to his fellow-men.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For love is naught but God's own nature, given,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In partial measure, down to man to come;<BR>
The sole delight of earth, the key to heaven;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the virtues, centre, source, and sum.<BR>

The Old Year.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The old year is dying,<BR>
Its last hour is hieing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the verge;<BR>
The night winds are plying,<BR>
And are mournfully sighing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its funeral dirge.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And now, in its even,<BR>
While its spirit is riven<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the bright zone,<BR>
Beyond the heaven<BR>
To whence it was given&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the unknown.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Its sadness in ending<BR>
Like a cloud is descending<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over my soul,<BR>
And the thoughts that are pending<BR>
With the low winds are blending,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping their dole.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A year of existence<BR>
Has passed to the distance<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er to return:<BR>
To the right was resistance,<BR>
From duty desistance,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor would I learn.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But duty neglected<BR>
And virtue rejected<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may amend;<BR>
Then why be dejected?&mdash;<BR>
So sorely affected?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence does it tend?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Is it that pleasure<BR>
In liberal measure<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not known?<BR>
Ah! rapturous pleasure<BR>
In memory I treasure,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&mdash;it is flown.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Opportunity wasted,<BR>
Though far we have passed it,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may retrieve;<BR>
But beakers once tasted<BR>
Of bliss while they lasted<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitterness leave.<BR>

A Summer Evening Scene in Chateauguay<BR>

WRITTEN IN MONTREAL.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Often, when the sun is sinking<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the mountain's glowing crest,<BR>
When the earth and heaven are linking<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that bond of peaceful rest;<BR>
Then, the weary city spurning,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this grand repose I gaze,<BR>
And my mind, in fancy turning,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwells on scenes of childhood's days.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And I float upon the river<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the selfsame time of day,<BR>
When the sparkling waters quiver<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath the slanting evening ray.<BR>
Day's harsh memories forsaking<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its jarring and its jest,<BR>
For the soul is but awaking<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the day is lulled to rest.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Glimpse of even's glory getting<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the summer sun serene,<BR>
In his softened splendour setting,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilds the spires of Ste. Martine;<BR>
Glimmers through the silent bushes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glances on the birchen stems;<BR>
Casts perchance his fitful blushes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the paddle, dripping gems.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And the hue of gold is deeper<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cornfields by the stream;<BR>
And the sickle of the reaper<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashes brightly in his beam.<BR>
And the fruits, of late commencing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To indue their glowing tint,<BR>
Richest beauty are enhancing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they catch his gentle glint.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Now he greets the gaudy dresses<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lightsome Gallic maids,<BR>
Rivals through their raven tresses<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes of jet beneath their braids<BR>
As the peasant party gathers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaily for the sportive dance,<BR>
As of old have done their fathers<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sunny vales of France.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But the night is falling thicker,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the twilight soon will cease,<BR>
So I paddle on the quicker<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past where Beauty reigns with Peace;<BR>
Where the little brooks deliver<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water laughing in its glee,<BR>
Or the murky English River<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingles with the Chateauguay.<BR>

Lines written on a Sabbath Morning.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The snow lies pure and peaceful on the ground,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serenely smiles the azure sky o'erhead:<BR>
The Sabbath spirit dwells on all around,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weekly toils and discords all are fled.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But, ah! my soul is filled with worldly thought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God, 'tis filled with thoughts of self and sin:<BR>
With seeming care and trouble it is fraught,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And peaceless discontentment reigns within.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Send down from heaven the Spirit of Thy love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its soothing influence in my soul instil;<BR>
Uplift my worldly thoughts to things above,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subserve my wishes to Thy better will.<BR>

Reflections on a tree in Autumn.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The tree, with its leaves in luxuriance shading<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My path in the tune-yielding time of the year,<BR>
Now sighs in its dirge, while its foliage, fading,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descends to its sepulchre withered and sere.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And yet I regard it with feelings the fonder,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With feelings of mingled compassion and pain,<BR>
As in pity I gaze on its branches, and ponder<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of once fragrant beauty what fragments remain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For that barren tree with adornment so fleeting,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That blows in the autumn wind bleak and forlorn,<BR>
Bespeaks the sad state of a heart that is beating,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereft of the pleasures that once it has borne.<BR>

A Parting.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Has the last farewell been spoken?<BR>
Have I ta'en the parting token<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thy lips so sweet?<BR>
Has their last soft word been spoken<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till again we meet?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Why is not thy hand extended?<BR>
Is my maiden queen offended?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or does she forget?<BR>
No! my queen is not offended,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is kindly yet.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For her eye is softly beaming,<BR>
And with tenderness is teeming,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle as the dove's:<BR>
With a holy light is beaming&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dare I call it love's?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But the time is fast advancing;<BR>
From the heaven of its glancing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must rend my heart:<BR>
Treacherous Time is fast advancing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I must depart.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ah! the pain the parting brings me!<BR>
As a serpent's fang it stings me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves me almost dead:<BR>
Ah! the faintness that it brings me<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the future fled!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
'Tis a darkened night of sorrow,<BR>
Waiting for the light of morrow;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it seems to me:<BR>
'Tis a night of pain and sorrow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I want for thee.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Two long weeks of weary waiting,<BR>
All my happiness belating;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will they be o'er?<BR>
Two long weeks of woful waiting<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'er I see thee more.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Divinely strong and beautiful in soul!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than melody of mortal voice!<BR>
The free thy spirit's majesty extol,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Liberty is made thy Muse's choice.<BR>
And then how pure and pleasing is thy song,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Beauty&mdash;goddess of thy mind&mdash;its theme!<BR>
But most to thee those sweet, sad strains belong,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Truth we find through musing's fitful dream:<BR>
And trace Uncertainty and how it gropes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this and time to come with faltering feet,<BR>
And vanity of Pleasure, and the Hopes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Fear enfeebles and the Fates defeat:<BR>
Strains oft as if at thy once-sung desire<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild west wind had ta'en thee for its lyre.<BR>

Oh! why should sorrow wound the heart,<BR>

Why is misfortune's bitter dart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowed to pierce the breast?<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
We dare not ask; 'tis heaven's decree,<BR>

Man's bark is tossed upon the sea<BR>

But Mercy holdeth forth a light<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
What comfort 'tis when cares annoy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know they are from One<BR>
Whose hand dispenses peace and joy<BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then cherish hope, despondent heart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strength renew the fight;<BR>
And God will gladness yet impart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy darkness turn to light.<BR>

The dreary winter soon is done,<BR>

Stay of the church and pillar of the state!<BR>

Her virtues to preserve inviolate.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much to thy power the platform, pulpit owes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy pen has held the Right and quelled her foes:<BR>

Ah! happy was I yesternight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trod the paths of love<BR>
Within Elysian fields of bliss,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enchanted bowers above.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
A heavenly maiden by my side,<BR>

By smiling water-brooks we strolled,<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
We breathed the breath of fragrant flowers,<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
We glided on through glassy glades,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, in the golden glow,<BR>
Fantastic forms by fancy framed<BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She seeming spake, but 'twas not speech,<BR>

The passing rapture of the hour<BR>

What though since then in Stygian gloom<BR>

I was enveloped in black clouds of woe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woven o'er my vision by dark-veiled Despair;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I breathed the poison of the midnight air,<BR>
And 'neath its dank oppression wasted low.<BR>
I staggered wildly in the gloom at first;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prayed in anguish that it be removed;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then cursed the day I saw thee&mdash;saw and loved,<BR>
And ceased to hope the clouds would be dispersed.<BR>
At last that Heavenly Love that rules the night<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removed thine orbit nearer to the earth,<BR>
And filled my soul with rapturous delight;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the place of that devouring dearth,<BR>
When I can see, though distant still, thy light,<BR>

Who sometimes still as in the days of old<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the evening calm and bright,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That followed on the fatal night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the sun was setting red<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Benmore's sequestered head,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weeping tears of yellow light,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, streaming down, bedimmed his sight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he prepared to make his grave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the deep Atlantic wave;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood and viewed with starting tears<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent scene of glorious years,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought me on my former pride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when I marched my chief beside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my clansmen strong and bold&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to our mountain hold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victorious in the bloody close,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weighed with spoils of vanquished foes&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the rocky glens around<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With peals of wild, triumphant sound.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I saw the bloody stains,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gazed upon the black remains,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought upon my murdered chief,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rage I quick forgot my grief;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deeply vowed of vengeance then<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the cursed Campbell men.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, alas! how vain my vow!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were Lochaber's warriors now?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thus to bitter grief returned,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adown the valley I discerned<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A figure, and my fading eye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female form could just descry,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who onward came in fleet career,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly as speed the frighted deer.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gait and garb so light and wild<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bespoke the maid the mountain's child;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her auburn tresses waved behind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bespread luxuriant on the wind;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from her soft and deep blue eye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In colour like the midnight sky,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There beamed a clear and beauteous light<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the blue of northern night;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to my side young Janet ran,&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride and flower of the clan.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With direful thoughts and faces dazed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We one upon the other gazed.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing she spake, but turning 'round<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence sought the cumbered ground.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bitter cry the maiden gave<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she approached the open grave;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as among its ways she went,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wailed this mournful, wild lament.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Once upon a midnight dreary, as I sauntered weak and weary<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a jovial fellow-student's room upon another floor;<BR>
As I sauntered, sadder, sicker, suddenly I heard a snicker,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lights began to flicker, and right out went three or four.<BR>
"Some infernal trick!" I muttered, as I neared my chamber door;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't stand this any more."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in my first September,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each night-attired member fled like ghost upon the floor.<BR>
Lamp I vainly sought to borrow, though I threatened on the morrow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would catch it to their sorrow, they would catch it sad and sore&mdash;<BR>
I would have them on the morrow the dread Faculty before&mdash;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearful here for evermore.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And the hushed and humorous talking, and the doors' successive locking<BR>
Filled me&mdash;thrilled me with fantastic terrors often felt before;<BR>
So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating<BR>
"'Tis some prank they are repeating that they played the night before,<BR>
"Sewn, perchance, my couch's covering, firmly fixed my chamber door,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Effigy upon my floor."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then toward my chamber turning, for my wonted slumber yearning,<BR>
Straightway I could hear them laughing somewhat louder than before;<BR>
"Surely," said I, "surely that is ominous, foreboding that is,<BR>
"Let me see, then, what the rat is, and this mystery explore&mdash;<BR>
"I'll discover what the rat is, and this mystery explore;<BR>

</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Open then I flung the portal, and&mdash;oh! miserable mortal!<BR>
Down there fell a pan of water in a most tremendous pour;<BR>
Not the least cessation made it, not a second stopped or stayed it;<BR>
But before I could evade it, down it fell from off the door&mdash;<BR>
Fell,&mdash;and with its icy current chilled me to the very core;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This there was, what could be more?<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Deep into the darkness staring, long I stood there thundering, tearing;<BR>
Shouting, threatening threats no mortal ever dared to threat before;<BR>
And my face was wild and ashen, and to aggravate my passion,<BR>
Each, in an insulting fashion, thrust his head from out his door;<BR>
And the worst of all the wretches met me with a mocking roar,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking,&mdash;Had I got to shore?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Instantly my speech grew stronger; I could stand it now no longer;<BR>
"Cur," said I, "or madman, my forgiveness now implore,<BR>
"For my patience now is sapping, and the truth is this is capping<BR>
"What too often has been happing, what in future shall be o'er,<BR>
"Now most humbly my forgiveness I demand that you implore.<BR>

And the wretches, unremitting, still are sitting, still are sitting&mdash;<BR>
Sitting each successive session on the freshmen as of yore:<BR>
Who, with burning indignation, and with angry imprecation,<BR>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
